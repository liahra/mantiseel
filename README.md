# Semester project presentation tool
Presentation tools like Keynote, Powerpoint, Prezi and the like, are powerful tools with a lot of complexity. There are other, less complicated tools like Slides.com and "Haiku Deck" that achieves more or less the same thing.

This assignment is about creating a presentation tool for web/mobile more in line with the simplicity of the later.

<ins>**Active**</ins> use of a clear agile development process and version control system is a project requirement.

### General project requirements
- Agile process with a feature map and project board.
- GitHub for source control.
- Normal usage of git for project work (branching, pull request).
- No third-party code (unless specifically allowed)
- Data is to be persisted in a Postgres database.
- Documented REST API for communication between client and server.
- No communication between client and server aside from REST API
- JSON as data transport format.
- Responsive HTML5 client
- The application must run on Heroku
- The application must work in FireFox
- Project report.

- Server API for Create / Delete / Update Slides
- Server API for Create / Delete / Update / Authenticate user accounts
- Server API for share/ unshare Presentations (private/public)

**Take note:**

We are not looking for a tool with a huge range of flexibility in layout and type of content. The crux is creating a clean simple and usable tool.

This is not an exhaustive list, feel free to add your own ideas and features. Each point on the list should be interpreted by you and your team. We are sticklers for the details so never assume, always ask.

The lists are accumulative so that an A requires that B, C and general requirements are met.

Having done everything on the list will not entitle you to that grade. The quality of your work will be a vital part of the assessment.

There might be mistakes / typos in the requirements. If so, it is the lecturerâ€™s interpretation that is correct.
